Firmware Update Process on Boot
│
└─ Start the boot sequence
   │
   └─ Initialize the system
      │
      ├─ Create a system manager with configuration and logging
      │  └─ Sets up core services needed by the system
      │      
      ├─ Check if firmware updates on boot are enabled in configuration
      │  └─ IF DISABLED: Skip the update process entirely
      │
      ├─ Begin network connection process
      │  └─ Prepare the network interface
      │     ├─ Get WiFi credentials from configuration
      │     └─ Start background task that maintains WiFi connection
      │
      ├─ Wait for network connection (with 60 second timeout)
      │  └─ Actively monitor connection until established or timeout
      │     ├─ Ensure WiFi is properly configured
      │     ├─ If needed, start the connection process
      │     └─ Poll connection status until connected or timeout expires
      │
      ├─ Get the device's network IP address
      │  └─ Retrieve the IP address assigned by the router/DHCP
      │
      ├─ Initialize the firmware update system
      │  └─ Set up the firmware update capability
      │     ├─ Check if firmware updater is already prepared
      │     ├─ Get device model and update server information
      │     └─ Create a firmware updater with the configuration
      │        └─ Will fail if update server details are missing
      │
      ├─ Check if a firmware update is available
      │  └─ Connect to update server to find newer versions
      │     ├─ Request latest release information from GitHub
      │     │  └─ Download metadata about available releases
      │     ├─ Process the release information
      │     │  └─ Extract version numbers and firmware details
      │     └─ Compare installed version with latest version
      │        └─ Determine if update is needed based on version numbers
      │
      ├─ If update available, download the new firmware
      │  └─ Get the firmware package from update server
      │     ├─ Find the correct firmware file for this device model
      │     │  └─ Filter available assets to find matching firmware
      │     └─ Download the firmware package
      │         └─ Transfer the file over HTTPS
      │            ├─ Handle secure connections and redirects
      │            └─ Download in small chunks to manage limited memory
      │
      └─ If download successful, apply the update
         └─ Install the new firmware safely
            ├─ Decompress the firmware package
            │  └─ Extract the contents from compressed format
            ├─ Extract the archive to temporary location
            │  └─ Prepare files while keeping current system running
            ├─ Back up existing files for safety
            │  └─ Create backups in case rollback is needed
            ├─ Replace current files with new versions
            │  └─ Move new files to their proper locations
            └─ Update the version information
               └─ Record the new version in system files

• If the update is successful, the device will reboot with new firmware
• If any step fails, errors are logged and the boot continues with existing firmware
